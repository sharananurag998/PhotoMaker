# PhotoMaker
Passport photo creation app in python

## Feel free to do improvements

I have implemented the basic functionality for arranging and resizing images in a passport size format. You can add options for the user to select the number of images and more. 

## To use:-

1. Run photomaker.py using python. 
2. A browse window will open, select the original image.
3. Your output will be stored in out.png file.

Thanks for checking out my repo!
